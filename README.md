## 🔴About
My project is a 2D side-scrolling game set in the enchanting and mysterious oak woods. In this game, players navigate through a beautifully crafted forest environment, filled with towering oak trees, dappled sunlight, and hidden secrets. The visual design emphasizes the lush greenery and the serene yet eerie atmosphere of the woods, creating an immersive experience that draws players into the game's world. As players journey through the levels, they encounter various obstacles and challenges that test their skills and reflexes, making for engaging and dynamic gameplay.

The main character in the game is a ghostly wraith, adding a supernatural element to the adventure. The ghost wraith is designed with ethereal aesthetics, featuring flowing, translucent animations that enhance its otherworldly presence. Players control the wraith as it glides through the forest, using its unique abilities to overcome obstacles and enemies. The wraith's spectral powers allow it to phase through certain objects, creating strategic opportunities and adding depth to the gameplay. This combination of a hauntingly beautiful oak woods setting and a ghostly protagonist offers a captivating and memorable gaming experience.
